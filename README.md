# tic-tac-toe
This is a simple javascript project to practice ` DOM ` manipulation and game AI.
On this personal project:
- The computer is in defence mood but if its going to win it will change its mood and attack
- Unless trapped by two options it block
- Every thing is solely done by me from scratch no chat-gpt no friend etc
